# Web-Design-Challenge
This assignment illustrates what I've learned about HTML and CSS. A dashboard was created to display the analysis that was previously completed in the WeatherPy assignment.

## Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
The website contains 7 pages total, including:

  * A landing page containing:
    * An explanation of the project.
    * Links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

  * Four visualization pages, each with:
    * A descriptive title and heading tag.
    * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
    * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

  * A "Comparisons" page that:
    * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page.
    * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    
  * A "Data" page that:
    * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
